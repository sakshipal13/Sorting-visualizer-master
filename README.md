# Sorting-Visualizer
WT Project
\\ The purpose of the Sorting Algorithms Visualizer is to help users get a better understanding of how sorting algorithms work through visualizations. Users can also compare the time and space complexities of various algorithms on the website. The users can adjust the size of the array to be sorted, the speed of the visualization and the algorithm to be used for sorting. User can also see how various algorithms perform in case of an already sorted array. \\
